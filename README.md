## Key Features  
- [Feature 1]  
- [Feature 2]  

## How to Contribute  
1. Fork the repository.  
2. Create a branch (`git checkout -b your-feature`).  
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).  
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin your-feature`).


     ##Technology Stack
   according to itrex several tech stacks are listed based on each role when we see them one by one
   front end
    JavaScript;
    when the project require small or light weight interactivity and for legacy system where modern frameworks aren't feasible
    react.js
   we mostly use it in a single page application, component reusability and ecosystem flexiability like cimbine with redux or Next.js
   Angular
   when dealing with large scale appd with strict structure

   when looking at back end
  web like .net node.js, python php laravel and django are the most used

   .net are mostly or are best used in areas like enterprise and window app
   node.js are mostly or are best in real-time , js full-stack
   java best when used in legacy system andriod backends
   phton prototypin AI/ML
   PHP web cms cost effective hosting

## 🔒 API Security

We implement multiple layers of security to protect our system and users:

### **1. Authentication**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless user sessions
- **OAuth 2.0** for third-party integrations
- **HTTPS** enforced for all endpoints  
*Why?* Prevents unauthorized access and man-in-the-middle attacks.

### **2. Authorization**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - `User`, `Host`, `Admin` permission tiers
- **Scope validation** for API endpoints  
*Why?* Ensures users only access permitted resources (e.g., hosts can't modify payments).

### **3. Rate Limiting**
- **100 requests/minute** per IP (adjustable per endpoint)
- **Redis-backed counters** for distributed systems  
*Why?* Prevents brute force attacks and API abuse.

### **4. Data Protection**
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for PII at rest
- **Masking**: Partial display of payment details  
*Why?* Compliance with GDPR/CCPA and user trust.

### **5. Payment Security**
- **PCI-DSS compliance** via Stripe/Braintree
- **Tokenization** for credit card data  
*Why?* Financial data requires highest protection standards.

### **6. Input Validation**
- **Schema validation** (JSON Schema)
- **SQL injection filters** (parameterized queries)  
*Why?* Blocks common exploit vectors.

### **7. Monitoring**
- **Anomaly detection** (failed login alerts)
- **Audit logs** for all sensitive operations  
*Why?* Enables rapid response to breaches.

> **Security First**: Each measure addresses critical risks – from data leaks (encryption) to financial fraud (payment tokenization). We regularly audit our implementation against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

> ## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

### **What is CI/CD?**
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.  
- **CI**: Automatically test every code commit  
- **CD**: Automatically deploy validated changes to production  

### **Why It Matters for This Project**
1. **Faster Releases**  
   - Deploy features/bug fixes in minutes instead of days  
2. **Fewer Errors**  
   - Automated testing catches ~80% of bugs before production ([State of DevOps Report](https://cloud.google.com/devops))  
3. **Team Efficiency**  
   - Developers focus on code instead of manual processes  

### **Key Tools We Use**  
| Tool              | Purpose                          |  
|-------------------|----------------------------------|  
| **GitHub Actions**| Run tests on every `git push`    |  
| **Docker**        | Containerize for consistent environments |  
| **SonarQube**     | Static code analysis             |  
| **Kubernetes**    | Orchestrate production deployments |  

### **Our Pipeline Stages**  
1. **Commit** → Linting & Unit Tests (CI)  
2. **Merge to Main** → Integration Tests + Security Scan  
3. **Release Tag** → Auto-deploy to Staging (CD)  
4. **Approval** → Production Rollout (Canary → 100%)  

> **Impact**: Reduced deployment failures by 65% in similar projects while enabling 10+ daily deployments safely.
