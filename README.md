     ##Technology Stack
   according to itrex several tech stacks are listed based on each role when we see them one by one
   front end
    JavaScript;
    when the project require small or light weight interactivity and for legacy system where modern frameworks aren't feasible
    react.js
   we mostly use it in a single page application, component reusability and ecosystem flexiability like cimbine with redux or Next.js
   Angular
   when dealing with large scale appd with strict structure

   when looking at back end
  web like .net node.js, python php laravel and django are the most used

   .net are mostly or are best used in areas like enterprise and window app
   node.js are mostly or are best in real-time , js full-stack
   java best when used in legacy system andriod backends
   phton prototypin AI/ML
   PHP web cms cost effective hosting 
 
   ## DATABASE DESIGN

   the key entities that are required for the data base designes are entities like the
   ### **LOCATIONS**
   --The data base must contain the locations that are most people could go
   --The database should provide the hotels registered under the web
   --The databese should also registor the database 
   ### ** HOTELS**

   --This hotels provided from the darabase are the hotels that are registred on the database
   --The hotels are provided based on the location that they are registered by 
   ### **THE PICTURES/VEDIO**
   --The hotels should provide datas to the database that are like the client will expraince before going there
   --this pictures or vedios should be pictures like the room pictures the view that the hotel etc
   --This pictures include the pictures of the surrounding and the HOTEL its self

   ### **RATING/ REVIEWS**
   --This are the revies and retings that are given from the users of the hotel to the hotels
   --This rating are mostly concerned about how the felt and expranced from the hotel
   --This is will make the cleint able to know what they might feel not from the hotels but from the users to coming client

   --Example two bed room, one bed room, VIP room, family room etc based ob the hotel prefarence and ability to provide for the client
   --So the price entity will take care of the diffrence in pracing 
   ### **PAYMENT METHOD**
   --Once the client choosed the prefered location, hotel, price and room type the data base should also be able to handle how the cleint pay
   --This might be connected be the banking system or other ways 
   ### **THE METHOD WE REACH THERE**

        --If the client is form around there might also include using google map to locate where the hotel is at
