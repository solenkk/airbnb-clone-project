     ##Technology Stack
   according to itrex several tech stacks are listed based on each role when we see them one by one
   front end
    JavaScript;
    when the project require small or light weight interactivity and for legacy system where modern frameworks aren't feasible
    react.js
   we mostly use it in a single page application, component reusability and ecosystem flexiability like cimbine with redux or Next.js
   Angular
   when dealing with large scale appd with strict structure

   when looking at back end
  web like .net node.js, python php laravel and django are the most used

   .net are mostly or are best used in areas like enterprise and window app
   node.js are mostly or are best in real-time , js full-stack
   java best when used in legacy system andriod backends
   phton prototypin AI/ML
   PHP web cms cost effective hosting 
 
   ## Database Design

   the key entities that are required for the data base designes are entities like the
   ### **LOCATIONS**
